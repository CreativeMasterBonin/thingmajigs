# Notice About Usage

You may use this code featured here freely. If you do make a license, make it open to use as well, (don't lock down and make a closed-source with these files, I won't stop you, I just hope you DO make it open source).

You can make variants of the code and the names of the blocks and items here can be used as well, just try to make them different.


It is recommended you use the mod as a dependency in addons instead of making versions of this mod instead.
You can create datapacks that override some recipes and such if you so wish to do so.
Note that if you DO change recipes to make it easy to obtain, as not ALL decorations feature storage and usage capabilities.

There is also some 'Create' dependencies in this section as well, so keep that in mind.
