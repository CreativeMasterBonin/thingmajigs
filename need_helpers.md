#Problematic things
Unfortunately, as the mod grows, so do you. NeoForge versions won't be made because the effort required is FAR beyond the capabilities of any one person, so, here is what we must do.

If anyone WANTS to port this mod to NeoForge and do the whole "pass the torch" thing, the Forge version of the mod will be maintained and updated to the next Forge version and stay as long as Forge itself exists, after that, the NeoForge version may be the main version.

If not a single person ports this mod, then only the Forge version will exist, and may stop being developed altogether (give it 3-5 years max of upkeep time for the Forge version, after that, no more updates).

This mod was fun at first, AND STILL IS, however I want to expand the versions further to at least 1 other modloader that won't be ruined or shamed, or whatever by whoever.

You may port the mod IF you do it right to the following mod loaders:
- NeoForge
- Fabric
- Quilt

Others aren't really needed as they are pretty small in terms of really good mods. These 3 represent the BULK of modding, +/- a few loaders that have come and go.
Note that CMB will work on Thingamajigs (and addons created for it) as long as they are for FORGE. Even though Forge is being dunked on, that doesn't mean the mod loader itself should be dunked on, and no, this is not flaming, just facts. Don't ruin something because of people, fix the issues yourself, if possible.

Remember that as time goes on, things need to change. Unlike other modders, this mod won't die unless the creator themselves dies. Oops, that was a little dark.

Anyways, thanks... :D ;) - CMB, creator of Thingamajigs, a decoration mod.
