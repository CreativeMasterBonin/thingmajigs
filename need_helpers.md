#problematic_things:


Unfortunately, as the mod grows, so do you. NeoForge versions won't be made because the effort required is FAR beyond the capabilities of any one person, so, here is what we must do.

If anyone WANTS to port this mod to NeoForge and do the whole "pass the torch" thing, the Forge version of the mod will be maintained and updated to the next Forge version and stay as long as Forge itself exists, after that, the NeoForge version may be the main version.

If not a single person ports this mod, then only the Forge version will exist, and may stop being developed altogether (give it 3-5 years max of upkeep time for the Forge version, after that, no more updates).

This mod was fun at first, AND STILL IS, however I want to expand the versions further to at least 1 other modloader that won't be ruined or shamed, or whatever by whoever.

You may port the mod IF you do it right to the following mod loaders:
- NeoForge
- Fabric
- Quilt

(i have nothing against modloaders wanting to change things)

This isn't just a thing with NeoForge already being a pain, rather, a modder issue. You get tired because every few years some horrid wall of doom says you can't pass, and your mod becomes stagnent, and can't move forward (you can't update it because you built up too much stuff at once that worked, and the next change is too massive for you alone to work on). And you said you would "never let that happen", yet it did to all the other good mods, so why would you be excluded? Oh well. Anyways...

Other mod loaders (the one offs that have already been abandoned or don't update to latest versions of MC) aren't really needed as they are pretty small in terms of really good mods. These 3 represent the BULK of modding, +/- a few loaders that have come and go.
Note that CMB will work on Thingamajigs (and addons created for it) as long as they are for FORGE. Even though Forge is being dunked on, that doesn't mean the mod loader itself should be dunked on, and no, this is not flaming, just facts. Don't ruin something because of people, fix the issues yourself, if possible. Players don't care about the code, they want the experience, don't remove something just because you don't like it. This is the idea behind good projects that last for years. They have all quickly (those good projects) become a catalyst for destruction, and CMB doesn't like that, and wants things to be better, but if they really won't be, then CMB will move on from said stuff, and not return ever again.

As time goes on, things need to change, yes, we all get that one, but, some things really shouldn't have ended so quickly. 
Unlike other modders, this mod won't die unless the creator themselves dies. Oops, that was a little dark.

Anyways, thanks... :D ;) - CMB, creator of Thingamajigs, a decoration mod.

BTW, there are other projects that aren't Minecraft I do have encase Thingamajigs fails. Hehe...



ALSO! If you weren't aware already, the mod needs some more *good* features again. *Usable* features. *Fancy* and *quality* features. Again, this mod was made for fun, and remains to be a fun project, but only if things don't become frustating. The railroad crossings first and foremost, they STINK in my opinion. I need someone who KNOWS how to program good entities to make the crossings. The US one in the mod currently, is a let down to me. If someone out there can make vanilla-ish looking jappa-ified textured railroad crossings with some features mentioned in https://github.com/roberttkahelin8/thingmajigs/issues/9, then please, do so and contact me, and I will credit and try to implement it as soon as possible. Not many are willing to do this stuff without some ridiculous cost or a catch involved. If you will do this stuff for free ONCE and without ANY strings attached, like I have with this mod, you may have a special mention in the mod, and permanently be known as a hero of railroad crossings (and other features you might be able to improve). No one said decoration mods like this had to be cheap and easily made. I hope to make it that way. Thanks for stopping by!

Again, if you DO help and provide good code and features that I like, I will approve and implement them. Screenshots are VERY much appreciated. If you are SUPER trustworthy, I'll even give you the ability to continue the mod itself, if you want, or you can just update your feature for every MC update and Forge update (if they still exist for as long as I'm thinking).
