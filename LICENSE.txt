This is not a (registered or approved by lawyer) legal document nor legal advice, rather a description of how you can use code, images, and other files put here (similar to other mods' licenses).

Files with the extension '.java' can be used in other mods (some code is from vanilla MC itself, modified from it's origin to be different and expandable).

Anything else is All Rights Reserved unless otherwise explicitly stated (meaning the author/authors give you the permission to use content).
This means you cannot currently use any images freely that have the '.img', '.png', '.jpg', '.psd', '.gif', or '.pxd' formats in this repository for anything.

You may not use any file formats pertaining to model files such as '.json' or '.obj'. This also includes '.json' files that are used for other purposes in this mod.

You may not repost this mod on any website. If you do, your website will be considered to be for 'malicious intentions'. You'll be reported.

You may view image and other non-java files, but not use them.

Note that this LICENSE can update at any time to reflect major or minor changes.
