A list of new features that are WIP and will be released in a future update (usually the next after the current public release, excluding public betas and alphas):
(These Features are usually made with 'parity' in mind so the experience is mostly the same):

1.7.3 Update (some features were requested):
* It's a secret!

* Add more mod compat support...
* Concrete Block (Brick, Grainy and/or Cobblestone) perhaps adding onto existing Concrete Barriers and/or new and old stuff (complete)
* Steel Block (complete)
* Metal Construction Fence (Stackable Vertically) (complete)
* Metal Bridge Railing (Horizontal Ladder style, slightly curved upward with 3 bars) (complete)
* Laundry Basket
* Laundry Pile (clean and dirty)
* Disco Ball

Future update:
?

"Perhaps I will add these features, maybe later, maybe now, idk" features:
* Writable gravestones (seems to be a bit tricky to implement based on the signs in mc, a prototype proved to partially work)
* Bigger Double Door Fridge
* More Chairs
* More Tables
* DJ-ing Mirror Moving Light
* DJ-ing Direct Multi-color Moving Spotlight

(Non parity features go here, meaning they won't match at all or are barely similar (neo versions/others excluding forge)):
* future plans later

Enhancements (Forge):
* future plans later

Bug Fixes That Are Done (Forge):
* future plans later

Dev and Other Features (may be exactly the same in more than one mc modding enviro):
* future plans later

A list of future versions of this mod (meaning different mod loaders or mc versions):
* 1.7.3 (1.20.1)
* ?.?.? (neo)

  

?.?.? Neo Feature Update (Rewrite for 1.21+):
- Redo ALL Blocks to have better supported functions and future-proofing
- Lockable Door blocks breaking progress if locked and can open using either top or bottom now, and key will only unlock/lock door from bottom half (due to visible handle).
- DJ Laser Light will be in perpetual NYI state until further notice, however can be placed and will show basic moving white laser.
- Signs and Road Content (other than a few other decorations) will be an addon instead of included by default.
- An addon for extra content will be created, such as Converter, Purifying Water and other miscellaneous features that don't fit the 'decoration' categories at all.
- Recipes and other data will be generated instead of premade manual files (allowing for fast updating of recipes when they don't seem balanced).
