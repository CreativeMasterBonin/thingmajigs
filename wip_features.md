A list of new features that are WIP and will be released in a future update (usually the next after the current public release, excluding public betas and alphas):
(These Features are usually made with 'parity' in mind so the experience is mostly the same):

1.7.3 Update (some features were requested):
* It's a secret!

Future update:
* DJ-ing Mirror Moving Light
* DJ-ing Direct Multi-color Moving Spotlight
* Disco Ball

"Perhaps I will add these features, maybe later, maybe now, idk" features:
* Writable gravestones (seems to be a bit tricky to implement based on the signs in mc)
* Bigger Double Door Fridge
* More Chairs
* More Tables

(Non parity features go here, meaning they won't match at all or are barely similar (neo versions/others excluding forge)):
* future plans later

Enhancements (Forge):
* future plans later

Bug Fixes That Are Done (Forge):
* future plans later

Dev and Other Features (may be exactly the same in more than one mc modding enviro):
* future plans later

A list of future versions of this mod (meaning different mod loaders or mc versions):
* 1.7.3 (1.20.1)
