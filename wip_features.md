A list of new features that are WIP and will be released in a future update (usually the next after the current public release, excluding public betas and alphas):
(These Features are usually made with 'parity' in mind so the experience is mostly the same):
* Trash Can (Complete)
* Change Machine (exchange emeralds for CASH and turn that CASH into COINS, neither of which will have a recipe) (Complete)
* Cash and Coins (Can be obtained by crafting a change machine and obtaining an emerald (bring 2 emeralds, one for crafting and one for using!), their purpose is for roleplay or if you want, add them in a datapack for actual gameplay usage) (Complete)
* Debit Card (used to exchange physical money for a representation of the money, and can be used at an ATM, and stores ~999999 money) (Complete)
* Special Character Statue #1 (requested feature) (Complete)
* Commercial Dryer (Complete)
* Commercial Washer (Complete)
* DJ-ing Gobo Shapes Light (Complete, doesn't render anything in the world, just a block)
* DJ-ing Turntable (based on multiple types) (Complete)
* DJ-ing Mirror Moving Light
* DJ-ing Direct Multi-color Moving Spotlight
* DJ-in Direct multi-color adjustable laser (working on customizability, renders a beacon beam that can do a lot of things)
* Disco Ball
* Item Displayer (shows the item inside it's inventory as a spinning display) (Complete)
* Glow Blocks (16 colors) (Complete)
* Lab Screen Blocks (Complete)
* Rubber Lane (Complete)


"Perhaps I will add these features, maybe later, maybe now, idk" features:

* Mobile Phone Enhanced menu
* Preparation for neoforge's 'c' tag before 1.21 (Completed)
* Worldgen changes (Unintended Completion)

Enhancements (Forge):
* All dyed pumpkin stems are colored coded to distinguish them from other pumpkin stems

Bug Fixes That Are Done (Forge):
* Black Pumpkin didn't turn into it's proper carved pumpkin and gave wrong seeds
* Microwave didn't have a loot table
* All blocks now have a proper loot table instead of generic ones (some have better loot tables)

Dev and Other Features (may be exactly the same in more than one mc modding enviro):
* Datagen (Loot tables, Block tags, item tags) automatically generated instead of manually created each time (reduces headaches)

A list of future versions of this mod (meaning different mod loaders or mc versions):
* 1.7.1 (1.20.1)
* 1.7.1 (1.20.4-neo)
* ?.?.? (1.20.5-neo) "because I want official player scaling and gravity, ðŸ˜ˆ"
