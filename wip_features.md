A list of new features that are WIP and will be released in a future update (usually the next after the current public release, excluding public betas and alphas).

Thingamajigs 1.6.9 Planned and Ready Additions and Improvements:

Updates:
- Changed some internals around again.
- More goodies for old features anyone?
- Vertical Redstone Blocks are tagged and bells tagged for logic changes, and as such, vertical redstone blocks' logic has changed significantly.
- HAWK signals have full functionality with a redstone pulse (they do a full real-to-life cycle).
- Paint Brushes have been updated functionally and visually.

New Features:
+ Netherite Anvil (WIP but somewhat working, text field doesnt save and has been disabled as a result, no recipe as well, allows free use of enchanting and repairing).
+ More US signs (because regulatory signs are forgotten about enough...)
+ Vertical Redstone Sidewalk (a full block version of the pole with a sidewalk look to it)
+ Barrel and Powder Kegs (Brewing and Blasting! Yoohoo!)
+ More factory themed blocks from an old mod redesigned from scratch
+ Runicstone blocks (a magicalish themed blockset)
+ Rubber obtained from generated Rubber Trees and their respective Tree Resin (forge tagged for other modded use cases)
+ and some other goodies
