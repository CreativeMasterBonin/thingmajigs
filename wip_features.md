A list of new features that are WIP and will be released in a future update (usually the next after the current public release, excluding public betas and alphas):
(These Features are usually made with 'parity' in mind so the experience is mostly the same):

1.7.2 Update (some features were requested):


* Conveyor Belt (slab-like and moves players in direction belt is moving visually, Completed)
* Analog Wall Clock (single hand to represent hours (each hour dot exists, but not each hour is shown), Completed)
* Fire Hydrant (multiple colors and produces water in direction it faces and removes it using the Key item (block is crafted with a water bucket and iron block so that infinite water makes more sense; doesn't interface with pipes or other modded blocks), Completed)
* More Tables (Iron and Copper, maybe more)
* Grate upgrades (Can be waterlogged now when placed in water and when a water bucket is used on them, fancy physics are NYI, Completed)
* Parking Meter (Completed)

Future update:
* DJ-ing Mirror Moving Light
* DJ-ing Direct Multi-color Moving Spotlight
* Disco Ball

"Perhaps I will add these features, maybe later, maybe now, idk" features:
* Writable gravestones (seems to be a bit tricky to implement based on the signs in mc)
* Bigger Double Door Fridge
* More Chairs
* More Tables

(Non parity features go here, meaning they won't match at all or are barely similar (neo versions/others excluding forge)):
* future plans later

Enhancements (Forge):
* future plans later

Bug Fixes That Are Done (Forge):
* future plans later

Dev and Other Features (may be exactly the same in more than one mc modding enviro):
