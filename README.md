# thingmajigs
A mod that adds decorations to your Minecraft Worlds.

Some easy to replicate source code from Thingamajigs will be made public for use as it does not feature code from Minecraft itself.

If you need help understanding what code you are looking at, it is specically Java language (the syntax) and Minecraft Forge methods and variables.

Please look in the downloads folder to see a list of compiled versions.
