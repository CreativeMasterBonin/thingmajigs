## About
This mod was originally called "Bluey's Thingamajigs", but a part of the name was omitted due to a personal problem with the term, 'bluey'.
It was started in 2020, and has been updating ever since. It has gone through 1 major rewrite and several smaller reconstructions of the mod. Versions 1.19-1.20+ are the rewritten version. Older versions of the mod won't be uploaded here (nor any source code) as they are under a different set of circumstances regarding shared code and textures.

## Why Is This Here
To allow users of the mod to suggest features in the **issues** tab of this repository and to report bugs that need to be fixed in the mod. If anyone has suggestions, feel free to open a report and tag it as a 'suggestion'.

Some easy to replicate source code from Thingamajigs will be made public for use. Some code is not used in the actual mod (or has been deprecated).
