# thingmajigs
A mod that adds decorations to your Minecraft Worlds.

Some easy to replicate source code from Thingamajigs will be made public for use. Some code is not used in the actual mod (or has been deprecated).

_This mod uses the official mappings Mojang Studios has provided to modders._ This mod only runs on the Forge modding environment.
Here is the official mappings usage message:
