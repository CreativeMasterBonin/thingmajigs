## About
This mod was originally called "Bluey's Thingamajigs", but a part of the name was omitted due to a personal problem with the term, 'bluey'.
It was started in 2020, and has been updating ever since. It has gone through 1 major rewrite and several smaller reconstructions of the mod. Versions 1.19-1.20+ are the rewritten version. Older versions of the mod won't be uploaded here (nor any source code) as they are under a different set of circumstances regarding shared code and textures.

## Why Is This Here
To allow users of the mod to suggest features in the **issues** tab of this repository and to report bugs that need to be fixed in the mod. If anyone has suggestions, feel free to open a report and tag it as a 'suggestion'. Users of the mod may also see suggestions by CreativeMasterBonin. These are suggestions the mod may be able to have as a full feature in the future, provided they do not need too much help to create. It is always a good thing to ask for help, however.

# What the goal of this mod is
To give users as many decorations as there are ideas in Minecraft, reinforcing the 'endless' part of Minecraft to the extreme, while allowing survival and creative players to enjoy the mod equally by using one item, the Thingamajig, to craft 'almost' everything in the mod where and if it makes the most sense to do so. As modders start living more (as in, their lives improve and they need to move on) and becoming less and less able to continue working on amazing mods, other people need to start continuing the idea of 'taking the torch' for these older, experienced modders, and have a try at the challenges of modding. In this case, Thingamajigs' goal is to re-implement a bucket load of decorative mod content from previous mods, and/or expand on others, while still bringing in as much fresh and original content as possible. A secondary goal is to remain a singular download, meaning Thingamajigs should not require a library or other mods to function at all (unless it is absolutely neccessary to get particular features working the way they really should be). The final (and most difficult) *end* goal is to make a final update that has enough features to satisfy the environment of Forge for years to come (or, at least, many years... more than ten is preferred but no one can guarantee anything will last that long or beyond that time frame).

Some easy to replicate source code from Thingamajigs will be made public for use. Some code is not used in the actual mod (or has been deprecated).
